// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

interface Car {
    manufacturer: string;
    modelName: string;
    [key: string]: any;
  }
  
  function createCar(manufacturer: string, modelName: string, ...options: [string, any][]): Car {
    const car: Car = {
      manufacturer,
      modelName,
    };
  
    // Adding additional key-value pairs to the car object
    options.forEach(([key, value]) => {
      car[key] = value;
    });
  
    return car;
  }
  
  const myCar: Car = createCar("Toyota", "Camry", ["Color", "blue"], ["optionalFeature", "Sunroof"]);
  console.log(myCar);
